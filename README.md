Selected for the second cohort of the *[Wanita Data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wanitadata_it-is-tonight-at-8-pm-7-teams-40-people-activity-7370376499243180032-ZTUF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADS-q9MBB4wzFiHkUq3nQUZ8gSQ0cdoIt9A)* Community Project — an 8-week team-based program focused on gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets. Chose Python as the primary tool for analysis among the available technical options.

My team analyzed **regional price movements**, **demographic preferences**, **property types**, **demand vs affordability**, and **time trends**. The findings were summarized into an infographic for public communication.

## 👩‍💻My Contribution
- Analyzed regional housing price trends and affordability gaps.
- Conducted time-series analysis on property prices.
- Created Python visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) for affordability and demand.
- Contributed to infographic design, ensuring clarity and storytelling.

## 🔑Key Insights:
- **Urban properties are 60% more expensive than rural ones**.
- **Almost 70% of houses bought are lower cost homes**, at prices lower than RM500K.
- **Small homes can be surprisingly expensive** especially in prime areas while bigger homes don't always mean pricier.
- **Landed properties prices remained stable at ~RM400K within 2021-2024** but high rise properties are increasing steadily over the years.

## 🛠️Tools & Libraries
